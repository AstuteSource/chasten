## üéâ Introduction

- **Chasten** is a Python program that uses
[XPath](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp) expressions to find
patterns in the [abstract syntax
tree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) (AST) of a Python program. You
can use Chasten to quickly implement your own configurable linting rules,
without having to use a complex AST analysis framework or resorting to imprecise
regular expressions.

- Do you want to ensure that a Python program has does not have any
triple-nested `for` loops inside of `async` functions? Or, do you want to
confirm that every function inside your Python program has type annotations and
a docstring comment? **Chasten can help**! It allows you to express these checks
&mdash; and many other types of analyses as well &mdash; in simple YAML files
that contain XPath expressions.

## üòÇ Definitions

- **chasten** (transitive verb) "to make someone aware of failure or of having
done something wrong", [Cambridge
Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/chasten).
    - **Example Sentence**: "Her remarks are a gift to me even as they chasten
    and redirect my efforts to expand the arguments of this book into a larger
    one.", [Cambridge English
    Corpus](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/cambridgeenglish/better-learning-insights/corpus)

- **chasten** (uncountable or singular noun) "a tool that analyzes the abstract
syntax tree of a Python program to detect potential sources of programmer
mistakes so as to prevent program failure", [AstuteSource
Developers](https://github.com/AstuteSource).
    - **Student Sentence**: "I'm glad that `chasten` reminded me to add
    docstrings and type annotations to all of the functions in `main.py`. It was
    easy to see what to fix!"
    - **Instructor Sentence**: "`chasten` makes it easy for me to reliably
    confirm that student programs have the required coding constructs. It's much
    better than using regular expressions!"
    - **Developer Sentence**: "Since I was already familiar with XPath
    expressions, `chasten` made it fun and easy for me to do an automate
    analysis of a Python codebase that I maintain."
    - **Researcher Sentence**: "In addition to helping me quickly scan the
    source code of Python projects, `chasten`'s analysis dashboard lets me
    effectively explore the data I collect."

## üîΩ Installation

Follow these steps to install the `chasten` program:

- Install Python 3.11 for your operating system
- Install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to support program installation in isolated environments
- Type `pipx install chasten` to install Chasten
- Type `pipx list` and confirm that Chasten is installed
- Type `chasten --help` to learn how to use the tool

## ü™Ç Configuration

You can configure `chasten` with two YAML files, normally called `config.yml`
and `checks.yml`. Although `chasten` can generate a starting configuration, you
can check out the üì¶
[AstuteSource/chasten-configuration](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten-configuration)
repository for example(s) of configuration files that setup the tool. Although
the `config.yml` file can reference multiple check configuration files, this
example shows how to specify a single `checks.yml` file:

```yml
# chasten configuration
chasten:
  # point to a single checks file
  checks-file:
    - checks.yml
```

The `checks.yml` file must contain one or more checks. What follows is an
example of a check configuration file with two checks that respectively find the
first executable line of non-test and test-case functions in a Python project.
Note that the `pattern` attribute specifies the XPath version 2.0 expression
that `chasten` will use to detect the specified type of Python function. You can
type `chasten configure validate --config <path to chasten-configuration/
directory>` after filling in `<path to chasten-configuration>` with the
fully-qualified name of your configuration directory and the tool will confirm
that your configuration meets the tool's specification. You can also use the
command `chasten configure create` command to automatically generate a starting
configuration! Typing `chasten configure --help` will explain how to configure
the tool.

```yml
checks:
  - name: "all-non-test-function-definition"
    code: "FUNC"
    id: "FUNC001"
    description: "First executable line of a non-test function, skipping over docstrings and/or comments"
    pattern: '//FunctionDef[not(contains(@name, "test_"))]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //FunctionDef[not(contains(@name, "test_"))]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1]'
  - name: "all-test-function-definition"
    code: "FUNC"
    id: "FUNC002"
    description: "First executable line of a test function, skipping over docstrings and/or comments"
    pattern: '//FunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //AsyncFunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //FunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1] | //AsyncFunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1]'
    count:
      min: 1
      max: 10
```

## ‚ú® Analysis

Since `chasten` needs a project with Python source code as the input to its
`analysis` sub-command, you can clone the
üì¶ [AstuteSource/lazytracker](https://github.com/AstuteSource/lazytracker) and
üì¶ [AstuteSource/multicounter](https://github.com/AstuteSource/multicounter)
repositories that are forks of existing Python projects created for convenient
analysis. To incrementally analyze these two projects with `chasten`, you can
type the following commands to produce a results JSON file for each project:

- After creating a `subject-data/` directory that contains a `lazytracker/`
directory, you can run the `chasten analyze` command for the `lazytracker`
program:

```shell
chasten analyze lazytracker \
        --config <path to the chasten-configuration/ directory> \
        --search-path <path to the lazytracker/ directory> \
        --save-directory <path to the subject-data/lazytracker/ directory> \
        --save
 ```

- Now you can scan the output to confirm that, for instance, `chasten` finds `6`
test functions in the `lazytracker` project. If you look in the
`subject-data/lazytracker` directory you will find a JSON file with a name like
`chasten-results-lazytracker-20230823162341-4c23fc443a6b4c4aa09886f1ecb96e9f.json`.
Running `chasten` on this program more than once will produce a new results file
with a different timestamp (i.e., `20230823162341`) and unique identifier (i.e.,
`4c23fc443a6b4c4aa09886f1ecb96e9f`) in its name, thus ensuring that you do not
accidentally write over your prior results when using `--save`.

- After creating a `multicounter/` directory in the existing `subject-data/`
directory, you can run the `chasten analyze` command for the `multicounter`
program:

```shell
chasten analyze multicounter \
        --config <path to the chasten-configuration/ directory> \
        --search-path <path to the multicounter/ directory> \
        --save-directory <path to the subject-data/lazytracker/ directory> \
        --save
 ```

- Now you can scan the output to confirm that, as an example, `chasten` finds
`10` test functions in the `multicounter` project. If you look in the
`subject-data/lazytracker` directory you will find a JSON file with a name like
`chasten-results-multicounter-20230821171712-5c52f2f1b61b4cce97624cc34cb39d4f.json`
and name components that are similar to the JSON file created for the
`multicounter` program.

- Since the `all-test-function-definition` check specifies that the program must
have between `1` and `10` tests you will notice that this check passes for both
`lazytracker` and `multicounter`. This means that `chasten` returns a `0` error
code to communicate to your operating system that the check passed.

- You can learn more about how to use the `analyze` sub-command by typing
`chasten analyze --help`. For instance, `chasten` supports the `--check-include`
and `--check-exclude` options that allow you to respectively include and exclude
specific checks according to fuzzy matching rules that you can specify for any
of a check's attributes specified in the `checks.yml` file.

## üöß Integration

After running `chasten` on the `lazytracker` and `multicounter` programs you can
integrate their individual JSON files into a single JSON file, related CSV
files, and a SQLite database. Once you have made an `integrated-data/`
directory, you can type this command to perform the integration:

```shell
chasten integrate all-programs \
        <path to subject-data>/**/*.json \
        --save-directory <path to the integrated-data/ directory>
```

This command will produce a directory like
`chasten-flattened-csvs-sqlite-db-all-programs-20230823171016-2061b524276b4299b04359ba30452923/`
that contains a SQLite database called `chasten.db` and a `csv/` directory with
CSV files that correspond to each of the tables inside of the database.

You can learn more about the `integrate` sub-command by typing `chasten
integrate --help`.

## üåÑ Results

If you want to create an interactive analysis dashboard that uses üì¶
[simonw/datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) you can run `chasten
datasette-serve <path containing integrated results>/chasten.db --port 8001`.
Now you can use the dashboard in your web browser to analyze the results while
you study the source code for these projects with your editor! Examining the
results will reveal that `chasten`, through its use of üì¶
[spookylukey/pyastgrep](https://github.com/spookylukey/pyastgrep), correctly
uses the XPath expression for `all-test-function-definition` to find the first
line of executable source code inside of each test, skipping over a function's
docstring and leading comments.

For the `lazytracker` program you will notice that `chasten` reports that there
are `6` test cases even though `pytest` only finds and runs `5` tests. This is
due to the fact that `tests/test_tracked.py` test suite in `lazytracker`
contains a function starting with `test_` inside of another function starting
with `test_`. This example illustrates the limitations of static analysis with
`chasten`! Even though the tool correctly detected all of the "test functions",
the nesting of the functions in the test suite means that `pytest` will run the
outer `test_` function and use the inner `test_` function for testing purposes.

With that said, `chasten` correctly finds each of the tests for the
`multicounter` project. You can follow each of the previous steps in this
document to apply `chasten` to your own Python program!

## üåé Deployment

If you want to make your `chasten.db` publicly available for everyone to study,
you can use the `chasten datasette-publish` sub-command. As long as you have
followed the installation instructions for üì¶
[simonw/datasette-publish-fly](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-fly)
and üì¶
[simonw/datasette-publish-vercel](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel),
you can use the plugins to deploy a public `datasette` server that hosts your
`chasten.db`. For instance, running the command `chasten datasette-publish <path
containing integrated results>/chasten.db --platform vercel` will publish the
results from running `chasten` on `lazytracker` and `multicounter` to the
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) platform.

Importantly, the use of the `chasten datasette-publish` command with the
`--platform vercel` option requires you to have previously followed the
instructions for the `datasette-publish-vercel` plugin to install the `vercel`
command-line tool. This is necessary because, although
`datasette-publish-vercel` is one of `chasten`'s dependencies neither `chasten`
nor `datasette-publish-vercel` provide the `vercel` tool even though they use
it. You must take similar steps before publishing your database to
[Fly](https://fly.io/)!

## ü§Ø Interaction

Even though `chasten` is a command-line application, you create interactively
create the tool's command-line arguments and options through a terminal user
interface (TUI). To use TUI-based way to create a complete command-line for
`chasten` you can type the command `chasten interact`.
