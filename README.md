## üéâ Introduction

- **Chasten** is a Python program that uses
[XPATH](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp) expressions to find
patterns in the [abstract syntax
tree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) (AST) of a Python program. You
can use Chasten to quickly implement your own configurable linting rules,
without having to use a complex AST analysis framework or resorting to imprecise
regular expressions.

- Do you want to ensure that a Python program has does not have any
triple-nested `for` loops inside of `async` functions? Or, do you want to
confirm that every function inside your Python program has type annotations and
a docstring comment? **Chasten can help**! It allows you to express these checks
&mdash; and many other types of analyses as well &mdash; in simple YAML files
that contain XPATH expressions.

## üòÇ Definitions

- **chasten** (transitive verb) "to make someone aware of failure or of having
done something wrong", [Cambridge
Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/chasten).
    - **Example Sentence**: "Her remarks are a gift to me even as they chasten
    and redirect my efforts to expand the arguments of this book into a larger
    one.", [Cambridge English
    Corpus](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/cambridgeenglish/better-learning-insights/corpus)

- **chasten** (uncountable or singular noun) "a tool that analyzes the abstract
syntax tree of a Python program to detect potential sources of programmer
mistakes so as to prevent program failure", [AstuteSource
Developers](https://github.com/AstuteSource).
    - **Student Sentence**: "I'm glad that `chasten` reminded me to add
    docstrings and type annotations to all of the functions in `main.py`. It was
    easy to see what to fix!"
    - **Instructor Sentence**: "`chasten` makes it easy for me to reliably
    confirm that student programs have the required coding constructs. It's much
    better than using regular expressions!"
    - **Developer Sentence**: "Since I was already familiar with XPATH
    expressions, `chasten` made it fun and easy for me to do an automate
    analysis of a Python codebase that I maintain."
    - **Researcher Sentence**: "In addition to helping me quickly scan the
    source code of Python projects, `chasten`'s analysis dashboard lets me
    effectively explore the data I collect."

## üîΩ Installation

Follow these steps to install the `chasten` program:

- Install Python 3.11 for your operating system
- Install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to support program installation in isolated environments
- Type `pipx install chasten` to install Chasten
- Type `pipx list` and confirm that Chasten is installed
- Type `chasten --help` to learn how to use the tool

## ü™Ç Configuration

You can configure `chasten` with two YAML files, normally called `config.yml`
and `checks.yml`. Although `chasten` can generate a starting configuration, you
can check out the üì¶
[AstuteSource/chasten-configuration](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten-configuration)
repository for example(s) of configuration files that setup the tool. Although
the `config.yml` file can reference multiple check configuration files, this
example shows how to specify a single `checks.yml` file:

```yml
# chasten configuration
chasten:
  # point to a single checks file
  checks-file:
    - checks.yml
```

The `checks.yml` file must contain one or more checks. What follows is an
example of a check configuration file with two checks that respectively find the
first executable line of non-test and test-case functions in a Python project.
Note that the `pattern` attribute specifies the XPATH version 2.0 expression
that `chasten` will use to detect the specified type of Python function. You can
type `chasten configure validate --config <path to chasten-configuration/
directory>` after filling in `<path to chasten-configuration>` with the
fully-qualified name of your configuration directory and the tool will confirm
that your configuration meets the tool's specification. You can also use the
command `chasten configure create` command to automatically generate a starting
configuration! Typing `chasten configure --help` will explain how to configure
the tool.

```yml
checks:
  - name: "all-non-test-function-definition"
    code: "FUNC"
    id: "FUNC001"
    description: "First executable line of a non-test function, skipping over docstrings and/or comments"
    pattern: '//FunctionDef[not(contains(@name, "test_"))]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //FunctionDef[not(contains(@name, "test_"))]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1]'
  - name: "all-test-function-definition"
    code: "FUNC"
    id: "FUNC002"
    description: "First executable line of a test function, skipping over docstrings and/or comments"
    pattern: '//FunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //AsyncFunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //FunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1] | //AsyncFunctionDef[starts-with(@name, "test_")]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1]'
    count:
      min: 1
      max: 10
```

## ‚ú® Analysis

Since `chasten` needs a project with Python source code as the input to its
`analysis` sub-command, you can clone the
üì¶ [AstuteSource/lazytracker](https://github.com/AstuteSource/lazytracker) and
üì¶ [AstuteSource/multicounter](https://github.com/AstuteSource/multicounter)
repositories that are forks of existing Python projects created for convenient
analysis. To incrementally analyze these two projects with `chasten`, you can
type the following commands:

- After creating a `subject-data` directory that contains a `lazytracker`
directory, run the `chasten analyze` command for the `lazytracker` program:

```shell
chasten analyze lazytracker \
        --config <path to the chasten-configuration/ directory> \
        --search-path <path to the lazytracker/ directory> \
        --save-directory < path to the subject-data/lazytracker/ directory> \
        --save
 ```

- Now you can scan the output to confirm that `chasten` finds `6` test functions
in the `lazytracker` project. If you look in the `subject-data/lazytracker`
directory you will find a JSON file with a name like
`chasten-results-lazytracker-20230823162341-4c23fc443a6b4c4aa09886f1ecb96e9f.json`.
Running `chasten` on this program more than once will produce a new results file
with a different timestamp (i.e., `20230823162341`) and unique identifier (i.e.,
`4c23fc443a6b4c4aa09886f1ecb96e9f`) in its name, thus ensuring that you do not
accidentally write over your prior results when you use the `--save` option.
