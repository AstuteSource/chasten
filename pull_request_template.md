When creating a pull request to add a new feature or alter an existing one,
there are some important elements to include to help our team review and process it more efficiently.

1. Describe the contents and goal of the pull request.

2. Will coverge be maintained/increased? 

3. What operating systems has this been tested on? How were these tests conducted?

4. Include a code block and/or screenshots displaying the functionality of your feature, if applicable/possible.

Mark as a draft until it is ready to begin the reviewing process, then tag our [Lead Software Architect, Lauren Nevill](https://github.com/laurennevill),
our [Principal Software Engineer, Bergas Batara](https://github.com/bergasanargya), and our [Founding Engineer, Gregory Kapfhammer](https://github.com/gkapfham)
